There is a huge amount of free resources available to you to help you through 
the course. Below is a list of Lecture notes and textbooks that are available 
either online or downloadable as a pdf. Some of these resources are only 
available through the McGill Library. If that is the case you'll be able to 
access them either while connected to the McGill wifi or VPN or by searching 
for them in the online catalogue.

### [Thermodynamics for Chemists, Physicists and Engineers](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-94-007-2999-5)
Robert Ho≈Çyst and Andrzej Poniewierski
Very clear explanations, lots of problems and solutions.

A brief and wonderful tour of thermodynamics with a snippet of history as well. 
Probably a good resource for review.
