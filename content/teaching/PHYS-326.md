The following are resources from PHYS - 326 (Statistical Mechanics), a course I 
assisted in teaching during the Winter of 2017. There are a number of 
notes/textbook suggestions among other things. Posts run in cronological order. 
The main course page, hosted by Professor Grant, can be found 
[here](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~grant/362/).

## Tutorial #1 - Scientific Computing with Python

In the first tutorial we did a brief overview of Python programming and some of 
the relevant tools for scientific programming with Python links to relevant 
documentation and downloads can be found below.

* [Anaconda Distribution of Python Download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [More about Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
* [Numpy User Guide (How to get started)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html)
* [Scipy Tutorial and Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
* [Beginners Guide to Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/beginner.html)

If you a good reference to get started with all of these tools take a look at 
the ["Getting started with Python for Science"](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/index.html) 
notes from Scipy. They step through all the basics of Python with a focus on 
doing science.

## Extra Reading

There is a mountain of both good and bad explanation of statistical mechanics 
topics floating around in the world. I'll list here the resources I've found 
the most useful for references outside of Prof. Grant's notes and Schroeder.

### [David Tong's Lecture Notes](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/statphys/sp.pdf)

David Tong's Lecture Notes are a great place to start if you're looking for an 
explanation on any topic. Can be a little sort on examples but the explanation 
of concepts is very good.

### [Kardar - Statistical Physics of Particles](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-333-statistical-mechanics-i-statistical-mechanics-of-particles-fall-2013/lecture-notes/)

Statistical Physics of Particles is a solid, modern textbook on statistical 
physics. You can also find the associated lectures by the author Mehran Kardar 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60gl3fdUTKRrt5t_GPx2sRg). 
The textbook has many examples of calculations as well as practice problems to 
work on.

### [Huang - Statistical Mechanics](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471815187.html)

Part B and C of Kerson Huang's Statistical Mechanics cover equilibrium stat mech 
and phase transitions (and other special topics) respectively. Practice problems 
can be found at the end of each chapter.

## Tutorial #3
Notes on the 2-state system example can be found [here](../../documents/twostate.pdf)

## Tutorial #6
Notes on Monte Carlo methods and solutions to the second problem set can be 
found [here](../../documents/Tutorial6.pdf)

## Finite size effect and the Ising Model

There was a lot of trouble with the finite size effect on assignment 4. Take a 
look [here](../../articles/ising-finite-size) for a discussion about the finite 
size affect and a simple implemenation of the the Ising model in the Julia 
programming language.

## Extra Extra Reading

Here is a list of addition resources pertaining to the second half of the 
course. For almost all of them you'll need to search for them through the 
McGill library to gain access, access them while on the campus network or 
through the VPN.

### [Critical Dynamics - Uwe Tauber](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/critical-dynamics/041557627C8F8F36D96084B7617BFD5D)

Section 2.4 contains a discussion of Langevin equations and Brownian motion in 
particular. The rest of chapter 2 contains an in depth discussion of stochastic 
processes in general including markov processes, the master equation, the 
Fokker-Plank equation and detailed balance. Some of the details are a little 
advances, including a few references to functional integration. If you see 
swirly D's, ignore them as best you can.

### [Statistical Physics of Fields - Mehran Kardar](http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521873413)

Statistical Physics of Fields is the follow up to Kardar's Statistical Physics 
of Particles. This is a fairly advances text book as well, but covers field 
theories and the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in particular for those that 
took interest in the topics right at the end of the course. You can also find 
discussion of mean-field theories here.

### [Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry - N.G. Van Kampen](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780444529657)

Van Kampen's text is a classic in stochastic processes. Good, indepth 
description of Brownian motion among other goodies. See chapter 9 titled 
"The Langevin Approach".

### [Theory of Simple Liquids - Hansen and McDonald](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123870322)

Chapter 4 contains a derivation of the scattering cross section using the wave 
function of neutrons. This is very much the same as what you should have seen in 
quantum mechanics. There are references to a "g(r)" which is the radial 
distribution function. You don't need to know what this is but you can learn all 
about it in earlier chapters of this book. If you're interested in perturbation 
theory in statistical mechanics, this is an excellent place to learn!

Everyone should read the first 3 pages of Chapter 2....just because its great.
