I'm a MSc student in Condensed Matter Theory the Department of Physics at McGill University. My specific interests are in solidification of pure and alloy systems including the following topics:

* Novel kinetic pathways in alloy systems
* Formation of secondary phases and other nonequilibrium phases
* Building quantitive theories of solidification at diffusive time scales
* Computational methods for Nonlinear Langevin equations

If you're interested in these, or other, topics in classical condensed matter check our the works of my advisor and others in the research group [here](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~provatas/.index.html)
