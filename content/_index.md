I like to think about, and build things, in the intersection of science and 
technology. Things like this little jittery checker board:

<div class="center">
    <img width="100%" src="https://ising.nfsmith.ca/"></img>
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="range">
</div>

Some of my recent projects are:

 - [Go-Ising: Ising model with real-time visualization and temperature API](https://code.nfsmith.ca/nsmith/go-ising)
 - [Maxima.jl: Symbolic computing in Julia using Maxima](https://github.com/nsmith5/maxima.jl)
 - [Motion JPEG Stream in Go](https://code.nfsmith.ca/nsmith/mjpeg)
 - [Self-Hosting Infrastructure using Kubernetes](https://code.nfsmith.ca/nsmith/kubernetes-resources)
 - [$\phi^4$ Simulation GUI using GTK](https://github.com/nsmith5/Model-A-Simulation)

I also write on occasion. Here are some of my recent articles:

- [Self-Hosting II: Kubernetes](/articles/self-hosting-part-1/)
- [Self-Hosting I: Motivation](/articles/self-hosting-part-0/)
- [Analysing Finite Size effects using the Ising Model and Julia](/articles/ising-finite-size/)
