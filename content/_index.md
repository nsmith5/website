I like to think about, and build things, in the intersection of science and 
technology. Things like this little jittery checker board:

<div class="center">
	<canvas id="canvas" width="512" height="512"></canvas>
	<input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="range">
</div>

Some of my recent projects are:

 - [Go-Ising: Ising model with real-time visualization and temperature API](https://github.com/nsmith5/go-ising)
 - [Maxima.jl: Symbolic computing in Julia using Maxima](https://github.com/nsmith5/maxima.jl)
 - [Motion JPEG Stream in Go](https://github.com/nsmith5/mjpeg)
 - [Self-Hosting Infrastructure using Kubernetes](https://github.com/nsmith5/kubernetes-resources)
 - [$\phi^4$ Simulation GUI using GTK](https://github.com/nsmith5/Model-A-Simulation)

I also write on occasion. Here are some of my recent articles:

- [Using PGP Keys for SSH on Fedora](/articles/gpg-ssh/)
- [Designing An Augmented Backus-Naur Form Parser Generator](/articles/abnf-parser/)
- [Monolith by Default, Microservice with Configuration](/articles/monolith_by_default/)
